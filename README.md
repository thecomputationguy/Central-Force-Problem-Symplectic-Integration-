# Central-Force-Problem-Symplectic-Integration-
Jupyter notebook to simulate planetary orbits under a central force (gravity).

At the moment, the simulation is restricted to a simple 2-body system using normalized units and arbitrary masses and initial conditions

TODO:

1. Use realistic physical constants and planetary attributes.
2. generalize to N-body-central-force system using object oriented methods.
